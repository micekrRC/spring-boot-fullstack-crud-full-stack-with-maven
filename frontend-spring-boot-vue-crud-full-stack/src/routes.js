Implementing Routing
When the user clicks the update course button on the 
course listing page, we would want to route to the course page. 
How do we do it? Thatâ€™s where Routing comes into the picture.


We are defining a Router around all the components and configuring paths to each of them.

http://localhost:8081/ takes you to home page
http://localhost:8081/courses takes you to course listing page
http://localhost:8081/courses/2 takes you to course page

import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  mode: "history", // Use browser history
  
  routes: [
    {
      path: "/",
      name: "Home",
// import ListCoursesComponent from "./ListCoursesComponent";

      component: () => import("./components/ListCoursesComponent")
//      component: () => import("./components/Courses")      
    },
    {
      path: "/courses",
      name: "Courses",
      component: () => import("./components/ListCoursesComponent")
//      component: () => import("./components/Courses")      

    },
    {
      path: "/courses/:id",
      name: "Course Details",
//      CourseComponent

      component: () => import("./components/CourseComponent")
     // component: () => import("./components/Course")
    }
  ]
});

export default router;
